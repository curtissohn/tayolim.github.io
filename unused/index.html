        <p>Have you ever craved for fresh salmon but found that sashimi was simply too expensive for your budget? Well I got news for you! The other day, my brother was making some sushi and he asked me if I wanted some salmon in mine. Um, <em>yes please thank you.</em> So he goes to the fridge and pulls out the biggest slab of salmon I&rsquo;ve ever seen. As he was slicing it up, I asked him if it was sushi grade salmon, to which he responded &ldquo;no, but I cured it&ldquo; .</p>
        <p>Some of you may not realize this, but salmon contains parasites that will make you sick if you eat it. One way to kill the parasites is to freeze it for about a week. Another way to kill parasites is to cure it with salt. And I mean doucing the meat in salt.</p>

            <p>The use of using salt to preserve meat has been practiced since prehistory. The idea behind this preservation method is to dry out the water in the meat so that microbs and bacterias will have trouble reproducing due to the lack of moisture. Sugar also has a similar effect and can be used to balance out the salt.</p>
            <p>So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the most basic salmon cure Gravlax recipe.</p>

                      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                        <li>A fresh salmon fillet</li>
                        <li>A lot of salt</li>
                        <li>Same part sugar</li>
                        <li>A bunch of dill <em>(optional)</em></li>
                      </ul>
                  </div>
              <small>*All the measurements depend on the size of your salmon. Honestly, don&rsquo;t think too much about precise measurement as long as it covers the salmon&rsquo;s surface.</small>

              <h3>Directions</h3>
                  <div class="list-2">
                    <ol>
                      <li>Debone and descale your salmon.</li>
                      <li>Rinse your salmon and pat it dry. Use your hands to gently pat the salmon to check for any remaining bones.</li>
                      <li>Generously sprinkle salt onto both sides if the salmon. More is better than less!</li>
                      <li>Repeat with the same amount of sugar.</li>
                      <li>Rub the salt and sugar all over to make it evenly spread out. In the end, the salmon should look all white.</li>
                      <li>If you have dill, this would be the step where you chop it up and pack it on top of the salmon.</li>
                      <li>Cover the salmon and put it in the fridge for at least 1-2 days. You will know it&rsquo;s ready when salmon juice starts forming a puddle around the salmon. This is the salt dehydrating the salmon.</li>
                      <li>When it is ready, rinse the salmon and pat it dry. You should end up with a beautiful red slab of meat.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                </div>
        <p>Gravlax is best enjoyed when you thinly slice the salmon (because it is pretty salty), however, you may prepare it however way you want. I personally like to eat as is or with sushi, but the point is, the salmon is safe to eat. Now, you can impress all your bougie friends while knowing you did not break the bank for all that salmon. Enjoy!</p>
